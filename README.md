# Returns Uncertainty-Navigated Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Flight Control

This repository contains the source code of Returns Uncertainty-Navigated Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RUN-DSAC), which I developed within my MSc thesis and used it to improve the sample efficiency and robustness of current RL-based flight controllers.
